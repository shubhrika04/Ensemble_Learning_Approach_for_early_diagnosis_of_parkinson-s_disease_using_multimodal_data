# An Ensemble Learning Approach for Early Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease using Multimodal Data
Millions of people worldwide suffer from Parkinson's Disease (PD), a crippling neurological condition 
that is becoming more common among the elderly. Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by 
motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, has a significant socioeconomic impact and 
has a profound effect on a person's quality of life. The lack of a permanent cure for PD is one of the 
biggest management issues, underlining the vital need of early diagnosis for prompt intervention and 
better treatment outcomes. 
Medical studies and technological developments have paved the way for early PD diagnosis. Clinical 
evaluations and neuroimaging are the mainstays of conventional diagnostic techniques, which frequently 
only work after the disease has proceeded to an advanced stage. Researchers and healthcare practitioners 
have used data-driven approaches in response to this constraint, utilizing the strength of machine 
learning and multimodal data to find early signs of Parkinson's disease (PD).
The zip file containing the dataset for this study was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset 
contained various features related to Parkinson's disease, including both vocal and clinical 
measurements. A variety of biomedical voice measurements from 31 individuals, 23 of whom 
have Parkinson's disease (PD), make up this dataset. Each row in the table corresponds to one 
of the 195 voice recordings made by these people ("name" column), and each column in the 
table represents a specific voice measure. The "status" column, which is set to 0 for healthy 
and 1 for PD, indicates that the primary goal of the data is to distinguish between healthy and 
PD patients.
